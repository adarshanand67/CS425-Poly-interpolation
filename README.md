## Introduction

This project is a part of the course CS 425 - Coding theory and Cryptography at IIT Goa. The project is based on the paper [Polynomial Interpolation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-construction.pdf) by William F. Smyth.

Polynomial interpolation is a method of finding a polynomial that passes through a given set of points. The method is used in cryptography to find a polynomial that passes through a set of points and then use the polynomial to find the secret key. The method is also used in the field of numerical analysis to find the polynomial that passes through a set of points.
